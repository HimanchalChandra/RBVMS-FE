## Installation 

### The code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.6

1. Install virtualenv

```
sudo apt install -y python3-venv
```

2. Clone the Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/ankursikarwar/RBVMS.git
```

3. Navigate to the sub-folder

```
cd RBVMS
```

4. Initialize virtual environment 

```
python3 -m venv my_env
```

5. Activate the virtual environment

```
source my_env/bin/activate
```

6. Upgrade pip 

```
(my_env) pip install --upgrade pip
```

7. Install the dependencies

```
(my_env) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

8. (Optional) Users may need to change the camera device index based on their webcam configuration. The default camera index is 0. Check line 43 in demo.py and line 42 in demo_visualization.py

9. (Optional) Users can also switch 'on' image enhancement to use the application in low-lighting conditions. See line 44, 45 in demo.py and line 43, 44 in demo_visualization.py

10. Starting the Application

Without Visualization:
```
(my_env) python demo.py
```

With Visualization:
```
(my_env) python demo_visualization.py
```
